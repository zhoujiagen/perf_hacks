##### Bounded Timestamps

In the `Bakery` lock, labels act as timestamps: they establish an order among the contending threads.

``` java
public interface Timestamp {
    boolean compare(Timestamp);
}

public interface TimestamSystem {
    public Timestamp[] scan();                      // snapshot
    public void label(Timestamp timestamp, int i);  // assign timestamp to thread i
}
```

**Precedence graph**: think of timestamps as nodes of a directed graph. <br/>
Time timestamp order is irreflexive and antisymmetric.
